It's the most
beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets
spreading so much cheer
I should be playing
in the winter snow
But I'mma be under
the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out
on the holiday
But I can't stop starting
at your face
I should be playing in
the winter snow
But imma be under the mistletoe
With you
shawty with you
With you
shawty with you
With you
under the mistletoe
Everyone's gathering
around the fire
Chestnust roasting
like a hot July
I should be chillin'
with my folks I know
But imma be under
the mistletoe
Word on the streets
santa's coming tonight
Reindeer flying through
the sky so high
I should be
making a list I know
But imma be under the mistletoe
With you
shawty with you
With you
shawty with you
With you
under the mistletoe
With you
shawty with you
With you
shawty with you
With you
under the mistletoe
Hey love
The wise men
followed a star
The way I followed my heart
And it let me to a miracle
Aye love
don't you buy me nothing
cus I am feeling one thing
your lips on my lips
That's a merry merry christmas
It's the most beautiful time
of the year
Lights fill the streets
spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in
the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out
on the holiday
But I can't stop
starting at your face
I should be playing in
the winter sonw
But imma be under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh
